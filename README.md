## üë®üèª Who am I?
üè´ I am a current *Senior* studying at the *University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill* majoring in *Computer Science* and *Applied Mathematics*.

üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I am passionate about bringing people together through technology. I enjoy working on teams with brilliant people, designing specifically with a persona in mind, and creating technologies that help to solve real world problems.

üíª I love to create full stack, focusing on angular, java, react, and python applications. I am also interested in exploring cryptography and it's uses in backend applications as well as AI such as LLMs models.

‚õ∞Ô∏è In my free time I enjoy being outdoors, working out, going hiking/camping, and spending time with others!
